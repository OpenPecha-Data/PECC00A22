Offering Prayer to Changshönma, Protectress Riding upon a Wolf
by Lodi Gyari Rinpoche

jo raksha pemé tensung tuwo ché
Bhyoḥ! Mighty guardian of the teachings of Padma, lord over the rakṣasas,
ma chik chang shyön lhamo khor ché chö
One mother, goddess riding upon a wolf, together with your retinue,
mitün kün sel tünpé lektsok pel
Dispel all disharmony, increase positive and favourable circumstances,
cholwé trinlé malü nyur drub dzö
And swiftly perform all the activities we request of you!

This profound and brief offering prayer to the protectress who rides upon a wolf was composed
by the one who holds the name of an incarnation of Lurab, Pema Lodrö Gyaltsen, in the sacred
place of Pemayangtse in the hidden land of Sikkim on the auspicious date of the 25th
day of the second month of the Fire Dog year (23rd April 2006) and written down by the dharma
friend, Gelek Namgyal.
