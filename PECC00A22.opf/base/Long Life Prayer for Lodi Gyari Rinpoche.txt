Prayer for the Long Life of Lodi Gyari Rinpoche
by Trulshik Rinpoche

om svasti
Oṃ svasti!
chimé tsa sum tsé lhé jinlab kyi
Through the blessings of the deathless deities of the three roots and all the deities of long-life,
khenchen pendé özer gyutrul gar
May the life of Lodrö Gyaltsen, the magical emanation of Khenchen Phende Özer,
lodrö gyaltsen shyabpé si tarten
Remain secure until the very end of time,
ten dror pendé trinlé kün khyab shok
And may his activity spread far and wide, bringing universal benefit to the teachings and beings.

According to the requests of the Sogyal Rinpoche and Rigpa Saṅgha, made together with the support
of an offering, and out of my own feelings of inspiration and devotion, I, the one named
Ngawang Chökyi Lodrö, who bears only the outer signs of a buddhist monk, made this aspiration
and wrote it down on the 6th day of the 10th month of the Wood Bird year (7th December
2005). Jayantu!
