Prayer to His Holiness the Dalai Lama
by Lodi Gyari Rinpoche

gyal kün nyingjé daknyi chenrezik
You are both Avalokiteśvara, the embodiment of all the buddhas’ compassion,
tokmé trinlé tsal dzé pema jung
And Padmākara, the one who is unobstructed in powerful enlightened action,
chik dü ngowo gangchen ten drö gön
Protector of the teachings and beings in the Land of Snows,
tendzin gyatso shyab la solwa deb
Tenzin Gyatso—to you we pray!

The one who holds the name of an incarnation from Lurab, Pema Lodrö Gyaltsen, had an experience
of recognizing the lama, and gave this to Gelek Namgyal in the hidden land of Sikkim in
the sacred place of Pemayangtse, on the auspicious date of the 25th day of the second month,
Fire Dog year (23rd April 2006).
