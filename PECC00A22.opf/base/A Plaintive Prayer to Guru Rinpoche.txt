A Plaintive Prayer to Guru Rinpoche

by Minling Chung Rinpoche


sangyé ngö jön orgyen rinpoché
Buddha in person, precious guru of Oḍḍiyāna,
dak sok nga dö güpé nar la zik
Turn your gaze toward us, tormented by these degenerate times.
kyé ma pö bang nam yang mi dorwé
Kyema! When you vowed never to abandon the people of Tibet,
shyal shyé tuk dam yalwar dor ram chi
How can you break your promise, and turn back on your pledge?

lé wang tsen shyé tukjé mi kyop na
If you say our karma is too powerful and your compassion cannot protect us,
khyentsé nüpé chewa gang du chi
Then where are your great wisdom, love and strength?
ré sa shyen mé nying né solwa dep
We have no other refuge, no other hope, but you—so from our hearts we pray:

tok mé tu tsal nüpé shuk chung la
Show us the full force of your power, in all its unlimited reach,
lokpar tawé gé tsa chépa yi
And protect us in our misfortune
kalpa ngenpé dro nam kyap tu sol
When our wrong views destroy our merit.

nying la gongpé chin lap phowa dang
Direct the blessing of your wisdom mind right into our hearts,
karpö bak chak sé pé gé tsen gyi
To awaken our virtuous habitual tendencies, and through this
nö chü güpé tsok kun shyiwa dang
Let the countless crises facing our world and its inhabitants be eliminated,
pen dé gé tsen gyé pé tashi shok
And let all be auspicious so that happiness and well-being reign and spread, far and wide.

om ah hung bendza guru padma siddhi hung
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ

This was written in Lhasa by Chung Ngawang Chökyi Drakpa of Ogmin Orgyen Mindroling on the 4th
day of the 6th month of the Water Ox year of the Rabgyal cycle (1973).
